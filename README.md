# MoonRaver
A FPS inspired by early FPS games in the 90s

This project was developed as part of a team project in the final semester of college and we had 12 weeks to develop it and my team role for the project was the programmer and essentially, I did most of the code for the game. The whole idea of the game is, itâ€™s a first-person shooter and you play a soldier sent on a mission to the moon to save the earth my destroying an enemy alien base. The game was heavily inspired by early first-person shooters in the 90s such as DOOM and other shooters such as call of duty and we wanted to pay homage to those games by including colourful artwork and simplistic silly story but also make the gameplay fast paced and enjoyable. Our other inspirations for the game were classic movies with their great action such as Aliens and the terminator but the idea for setting of the game on the moon was inspired by the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. To navigate through the level, you must collect crystals scattered through the level to unlock the next level we decided to do this because it will give the player a reason to explore the level and see what there is.
